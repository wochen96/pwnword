# Pwnword

This is a data analysis report final project for INFO 201 at the University of Washington. This project was created by Wo Bin Chen, William Tan, and Jackie Trenh.

This project is about analyzing the data obtained from https://haveibeenpwned.com/, a website created by Troy Hunt. We made charts and tables to closely look at the amount of hacking that is happening in our world today.
